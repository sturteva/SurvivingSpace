To Do:

Probably remove rooms from noun list.
	If rooms stay in noun list, make them unaccessible by non-go commands other than possibly look/look at.
Add more nouns.
Check in regards to what player should do with "ruins" as a target word (go to whichever is accessible from position? What if both accessible?).
Add non-cardinal directions.
Find out why west doesn't want to exist.
Work on endless loop bugged commands.
