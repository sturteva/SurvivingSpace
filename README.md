========================================================== Walkthrough ====================================================

This walkthrough starts from the starting screen of Surviving Space! Everything you see is the barebones input you need. 
Feel free to experiment with the use of natural language with the command line, such as “Pick up the odd bag” instead of 
“take bag” or one of Britany’s personal favorites for debugging the language parser: “Angrily cut the stupid bushes with 
the weird knife.” The instructions are provided with some examples of natural language in usage with an abbreviated 
shorthand command following this in parentheses to allow for speedier testing and debugging.
