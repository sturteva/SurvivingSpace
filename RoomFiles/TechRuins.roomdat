<Name>Tech Ruin</Name>
<FD>What used to be large buildings long ago, appear to half crumbling and falling apart.  Some of these buildings appear to have once been a school, hospital, warehouse, and even some sort of civic center.  The architecture is foreign to you, but some of the galaxy-wide accepted symbols are present. There is rubble and trash left from whoever built these buildings.</FD>
